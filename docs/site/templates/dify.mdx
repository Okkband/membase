Before you can use the plugin, you need access to Memobase Dashboard:

*   **Memobase Dashboard:** Sign up for a managed Memobase instance through the [Memobase dashboard](https://www.memobase.io/en/dashboard). This is the quickest way to get started without needing to manage your own infrastructure.
*   **Self-Hosted Instance:** You can deploy your own instance of Memobase. Visit the [Memobase GitHub repository](https://github.com/memodb-io/memobase) for installation instructions and more information.

## Plugin Setup in Dify

To integrate Memobase with Dify using the plugin, you'll need to add it as a tool in your Dify application and provide the necessary credentials for your Memobase Cloud instance:

1.  **Memobase URL:** The API endpoint URL of your Memobase Cloud instance. This will be provided in your Memobase Cloud dashboard (e.g., `https://api.memobase.dev`).
2.  **Memobase API Key:** Your unique API key for authenticating with your Memobase Cloud instance. You can obtain this from your [Memobase dashboard](https://www.memobase.io/en/dashboard).

You can find these details in your Memobase Cloud dashboard.
