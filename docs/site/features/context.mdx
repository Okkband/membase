title: Personalized Context
---

Memobase may extract many kinds of memories from user, for example:
- User profile
- User events
- ...

And all of them are a part of the user's personalized context.

Memobase offers an API to get the personalized context of a user without packing those memories yourself:
```python
from memobase import MemobaseClient, ChatBlob

client = MemobaseClient(api_key="your_api_key")
uid = client.add_user()
u = client.get_user(uid)

u.insert(
    ChatBlob(
        messages=[{
                "role": "user",
                "content": "I'm Gus"
        }]
    )
)

print(u.context())
```
Detailed params is in [here](/api-reference/prompt/get_context).
